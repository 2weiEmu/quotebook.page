# Quotebook of some Random AE Shitters

This website is going to be an automated quotebook of some guys from Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft (and just one random computer science guy perhaps if he ever says something quote-worthy). Here you can find all the important quotes.

Maybe in the future some random guy with too much time is going to add Discord integration, also for the existing quotebook channel that exists there. For now, enjoy searching for quotes, and adding new ones. Is it simple yes? Are the people that made this website / writing the quotes on it simple? Yes.
