# Quotebook of some Random AE Shitters

This website is going to be an automated quotebook of some guys from Aerospace Engineering at the TU Delft (and just one random computer science guy perhaps if he ever says something quote-worthy). Here you can find all the important quotes.

This website was written / is going to be writte in Golang - for the simple sake of spiting all the people using Javascript - also it performs better, and if these people ever decide that 10GB of quote data is to their pleasing well - well in that case that is honestly on the Database but yea...

Maybe in the future some random guy with too much time is going to add Discord integration, also for the existing quotebook channel that exists there. For now, enjoy searching for quotes, and adding new ones. Is it simple yes? Are the people that made this website / writing the quotes on it simple? Yes.
